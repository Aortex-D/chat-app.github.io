## ⚙️ How to Customize

### 1. Editing Bot Responses
- Open **`main.js`**
- Find the section where responses are defined (objects or functions).
- Replace the text inside strings (`"..."`) with your own responses.

---

### 2. Adding / Changing Option Buttons
- Buttons are dynamically generated inside **`main.js`**.
- Each button has a `text` (what the user sees) and a `next` (the linked response).

- To add new buttons, just insert a new object in the list.

### 3. Styling the Chat
- Open **`style.css`** to change appearance.
- You can update:
  - **Colors / Gradients** (background, messages, buttons)  
  - **Font styles**  
  - **Button hover effects**
